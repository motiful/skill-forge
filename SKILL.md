# Skill Forge

Skill engineering methodology and publishing pipeline. Defines what "well-engineered skill" means, validates skills against that standard, and produces publishable GitHub repos.

## Engagement Principles

These rules govern all modes. Read them before acting.

1. **Assess before acting** — first step is always understanding the situation (scan, inventory, read)
2. **Report before modifying** — show findings, get user approval, then act
3. **Security > Structure > Quality > Polish** — when multiple issues exist, fix in this priority
4. **Default to local-ready** — both modes run through validation and fixes until the skill is local-ready. User can stop at any point
5. **One skill at a time for changes** — diagnose in batch, but modify one by one with user confirmation
6. **Push is a single action, not a pipeline** — local-ready means everything is done; push only sends to remote
7. **Understand context** — a skill may belong to a tool, or relate to other skills. Don't treat each in isolation

## Modes

Two modes. Push is a single action after either mode reaches local ready.

### Review (skill already exists)

**Signal**: "review", "check", "audit", "forge"

**Flow**: Step 0 → Locate → Step 3 (Validate) → Report → Fix → Local Ready

The skill can be local (path) or remote (GitHub URL — clone to temp directory). Review does not require Step 1 or Step 2 (the skill already exists). Step 0 is required — Step 3 validation depends on tools installed by setup.sh (readme-craft for README quality, self-review for cross-pillar alignment).

**Multi-skill**: if multiple skills are detected (project scan or user request like "audit all my skills"), inventory all SKILL.md files, triage by severity (security > structure > quality), present a plan, then Review each skill one at a time.

**Graduation**: if the skill is project-local (e.g. `<project>/.claude/skills/bar/`), prompt to move it to `<skill_root>/<name>/` first. Run graduation assessment (project-specific references, hardcoded paths, project-internal dependencies), clean up, then continue Review.

```
Source: <project>/.claude/skills/bar/    (or platform equivalent)
Target: <skill_root>/bar/
```

Copy content (`cp -r <source>/* <skill_root>/<name>/`), clean up, validate. Original stays in the project — independent evolution.

**Severity**: Critical = must fix. Warning = recommend fix (user confirms). Info = report only.

### Create (skill does not exist)

**Signal**: "create a skill", "build a skill for X"

**Flow**: Step 0 → Step 1 → Step 2 → Step 3 (Validate) → Fix → Local Ready

**Checkpoints**: confirm skill scope, confirm content

### Local Ready Definition

A skill is "local ready" when ALL of the following are true:

```
<skill-name>/
├── SKILL.md                           # validated (Step 3 passed)
├── references/                        # if needed, all links resolve
├── scripts/                           # if needed, setup.sh works
├── README.md                          # audited by readme-craft
├── LICENSE                            # exists
└── .gitignore                         # matches template
```

- `git init` done, initial commit made
- Local registration (symlinks) done for all detected platform roots
- All Critical and Warning issues from Step 3 resolved
- README audited by readme-craft (not just manually checked)

**Local ready = push-ready.** The only remaining action is a network operation.

### Push (single action after local ready)

**Signal**: "push", "publish to GitHub", "put this on GitHub"

Push is NOT a mode — it is a single action the user triggers after a skill reaches local ready. No validation, no artifact creation — everything is already done.

**Flow**: Confirm remote target → `gh repo create` + `git push`

See [Push to Remote](#push-to-remote) for the exact procedure.

## Operation Modules

Steps 0–3 are reusable building blocks. Modes define which steps run and in what order. Push is a standalone action after local ready.

### Step 0: Environment Setup

#### 0a. Installation

Run `scripts/setup.sh` to check and install all dependencies.

```
1. Run scripts/setup.sh
2. Exit 0 → proceed
3. Exit non-zero → report error to user, stop
```

**Dependencies** (installed by setup.sh):
- **CLI tools**: `gh`, `node`, `npx`
- **Skills**: `motiful/readme-craft`, `motiful/rules-as-skills`, `motiful/self-review`

See `references/installation.md` for the setup.sh standard.

#### 0b. Onboarding (first use only)

If `~/.config/skill-forge/config.md` does not exist, run onboarding:

1. **Detect** — `github_org` via `gh api user -q .login`, platform from current agent
2. **Summarize** — show detected defaults:
   ```markdown
   # Skill Forge Config
   ## Defaults
   - skill_root: ~/skills/
   - github_org: <detected>
   - license: MIT
   ```
3. **Confirm once** — ask for approval
4. **Write** — create `~/.config/skill-forge/config.md`

**`skill_root`** defaults to `~/skills/`. Tell the user: *"Your skills will live in `~/skills/` — each skill gets its own folder and git repo there. You can change this anytime in `~/.config/skill-forge/config.md`."*

See `references/onboarding.md` for the onboarding pattern.

#### 0c. Config Check

Read `~/.config/skill-forge/config.md`.

**Found** → read user's preferences and proceed.

**Not found** (and onboarding didn't run) → create with detected defaults (see 0b).

#### User Conventions

Check for the user's existing conventions. Scan in priority order:

1. **Forge config** — `~/.config/skill-forge/config.md` (platform-agnostic, created above)
2. **Project instructions** — `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, or equivalent for the current platform
3. **Platform rules directory** — if it exists (CC: `~/.claude/rules/`, Cursor: `~/.cursor/rules/`, etc.)

If the user has established conventions (naming, structure, org, licensing), **follow them** in Create and **validate against them** in Review. Skill-forge provides defaults for users who don't have conventions yet, not overrides for users who do.

#### Positioning

Skill Forge creates **independent, publishable skill repositories**. If the user just wants a quick project-internal skill (not shared), guide them to the platform's built-in skill creator instead.

Skill Forge optimizes for **public artifact quality**: installability, maintainability, composition quality, README clarity, honest claims. It does **not** certify domain excellence or real-world effectiveness.

### Step 1: Gather

#### Context Detection (automatic)

Before asking anything, detect what's already available:

1. **Current project scan** — Look for existing skill content:
   - `.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md` (or platform equivalent)
   - `skill/SKILL.md` in the working directory
   - If Step 0 found forge config: `<skill_root>/*/SKILL.md` (one level deep only; prefer exact name matches or user-referenced paths)
   - Any `SKILL.md` file the user might be working on

2. **Conversation context** — Has the user been discussing a skill idea? Are there notes, specs, or requirements already in the conversation?

3. **Explicit references** — Did the user point to specific files or directories?

**If one clear match is found** → proceed with it automatically.

If multiple likely matches are found, summarize the candidate paths and ask which one to use.

**If nothing found** → then ask:
- What does this skill do? (1-2 sentences)
- When should it trigger? (specific phrases, file types, scenarios)

#### Location Rule

Where the skill lives depends on context:

| Situation | Where to work |
|-----------|---------------|
| Skill already has a location (with or without git) | **In-place** — work where it is |
| Create mode (no existing files) | **`<skill_root>/<skill-name>/`** — the default |
| Graduation (explicit move request) | **Copy to `<skill_root>/<skill-name>/`** — user asked for the move |

Forge does not force-move the author's files. `skill_root` is the default for new skills, not a mandatory destination.

#### Publishing Strategy

Before creating, determine the repo strategy. See `references/publishing-strategy.md` for detailed guidance.

**Quick decision:** One skill → Skill repo (SKILL.md at root). Multiple tightly-coupled skills → see `references/publishing-strategy.md` for Skill vs Collection. For composition philosophy, see `references/skill-composition.md`.

#### Ecosystem Check (Create mode only)

Before writing new content, check if similar skills already exist:

1. **Search** — `npx skills find <keyword>` or search skills.sh for the domain
2. **Found similar?** → present to user with options:

| Finding | Recommendation |
|---------|---------------|
| Good match exists as standalone repo | Depend on it (`scripts/setup.sh`), don't recreate |
| Partial match — needs significant customization | Fork and adapt, or create new with the existing as reference |
| Nothing similar | Create from scratch |

Skip this check in Review mode — it works with existing skills.

#### Capability Detection

Detect which capabilities the skill needs. This is not optional — detect and act.

| Capability | Detection question | Action | Reference |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Installation** | Does the skill have dependencies to install? (tools, skills, npm packages) | Add `scripts/setup.sh` + Step 0 that runs it | `references/installation.md` |
| **Onboarding** | Does the skill need first-use user guidance? (profile setup, credentials, preferences) | Add onboarding flow in Step 0 | `references/onboarding.md` |
| **Rule-Skill Split** | Does the skill contain 3+ MUST/NEVER constraints that users may want to customize? | Auto-create paired `<name>-rules` skill | `references/rule-skill-pattern.md` |

**Rule-Skill Split is detection-driven**: if constraints are detected, forge creates the paired skill automatically. If no constraints detected, nothing is created. The user is not asked whether to create it — forge decides based on content.

### Step 2: Create

Write SKILL.md following the Agent Skills open standard. See `references/skill-format.md` for the complete format specification (frontmatter, CC extensions, body conventions, file structure, content guidelines).

Key principle: write for another AI agent, not a human. Keep body under 500 lines — use `references/` files for detailed content.

#### Baking In Detected Capabilities

For capabilities detected in Step 1, bake the corresponding structure into the generated SKILL.md:

- **Installation** → Add `scripts/setup.sh` that checks and installs all declared dependencies. Add a Step 0 that runs setup.sh. See `references/installation.md`
- **Onboarding** → Add first-use guidance in Step 0 (after setup.sh). See `references/onboarding.md`
- **Rule-Skill Split** → Auto-create a separate `<name>-rules` skill alongside the main skill. See `references/rule-skill-pattern.md`

These patterns are **transparent to the end user** — they work without the end user having skill-forge installed. Forge bakes them in at creation time; the generated skill is self-contained (independent from forge, not from its own dependencies).

#### Dependencies in Generated Skills

If the skill being created has dependencies (other skills, CLI tools, npm packages), they must be declared and installed:

- Declare in SKILL.md Step 0 and implement in `scripts/setup.sh`
- Mirror in README's "Dependencies" section
- No fallback behavior — dependencies are installed or the skill blocks with an error

#### Repo Artifacts

Step 2 creates ALL publishable files, not just SKILL.md:

| File | Source | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| `SKILL.md` | Written in this step | Core skill content |
| `README.md` | Generated by readme-craft | Value-first structure, see `references/readme-quality.md` and `references/templates.md` |
| `LICENSE` | From `references/templates.md` | Default MIT, or per forge config |
| `.gitignore` | From `references/templates.md` | Standard template |

README requirements (enforced by readme-craft):
- **Value-first**: Problem → What It Does → Usage → Install → What's Inside
- Must mention [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) compatibility
- Primary install: `npx skills add <org>/<skill-name>`. Manual clone as fallback
- If dependencies exist, add a "Dependencies" section
- Include a "What's Inside" section showing skill files
- Include a "Forged with Skill Forge" footer

### Step 3: Validate

#### Project-Specific Standards

Before running checks, scan the target project for its own quality standards. These become additional validation criteria on top of Core Validation.

Scan in order:
1. **Project instructions** — `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, or platform equivalents
2. **Editor/linter configs** — `.editorconfig`, linter configs
3. **Rules directory** — `.claude/rules/*.md`, `.cursor/rules/*.mdc`, etc.

Extract actionable rules (e.g., "references >100 lines must have a TOC", "description must include a negative trigger") and check them alongside Core Validation. Report violations attributed to the project's own standard, not skill-forge's.

If the target project has no project-specific standards, proceed with Core Validation only.

#### Core Validation

| Check | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| Frontmatter fields | Only standard top-level fields: `name`, `description`, `license`, `metadata`, `compatibility`, `allowed-tools`. Put CC-specific or custom fields inside `metadata` |
| `name` | kebab-case, max 64 chars, lowercase alphanumeric + hyphens. Must not start/end with hyphen, no consecutive hyphens (`--`), must match parent directory name |
| `description` | Present, < 1024 chars, **single-line** (no YAML multi-line `>-` or `|` — causes skills to silently disappear in CC). If value contains `: ` (colon-space), must be quoted — strict YAML parsers (e.g. Codex) will reject unquoted colons as mapping indicators |
| Description coverage | Does the description mention the key trigger scenarios from the SKILL.md body? For each major capability or workflow in the body, check if the description includes a corresponding trigger phrase. Report gaps as warnings with suggested additions. Report description claims absent from body as over-promises |
| Body | Under 500 lines, has meaningful content (not just TODOs) |
| References | All files referenced in SKILL.md actually exist |
| No junk files | For multi-skill repos: no README.md, CHANGELOG.md, or docs inside `skills/<name>/`. For single-skill repos: SKILL.md, references/, assets/, scripts/ at root alongside README.md and LICENSE is the expected structure |
| Dependencies | If the skill declares dependencies, verify `scripts/setup.sh` exists and handles each one. Dependencies must be installed, not optional |
| Runtime write to skill directory | Skill directory should have no runtime-written data files. Flag `.claude/skills/<name>/data/`, `.claude/skills/<name>/cache/`, or any non-published file | Warning |
| Assets misuse | `assets/` only holds AI-consumed source material. Logo, screenshots, and repo infrastructure belong in `.github/` or root level, not in `assets/` | Warning |
| Meta-skill contamination | Skill repo should not contain tooling skills (skill-forge, skill-creator) as subdirectories. Detect `skills/skill-forge/`, `.claude/skills/skill-forge/`, `.agents/skills/skill-forge/` or similar inside the repo. Remediation: `rm -rf <path>` then `npx skills add motiful/skill-forge -g` (tooling skills belong at global scope, not inside the skill being forged) | Warning |
| Collection context budget | For multi-skill repos: count total skills. 15+ skills → warn about context flooding (descriptions alone consume ~1.5K+ tokens). Recommend selective install (`--skill`) in README | Warning |
| Collection name collision | For multi-skill repos: flag generic skill names (`code-review`, `landing-page`) that are likely to collide with standalone skills the user may already have. Recommend namespacing (`<domain>-code-review`) | Warning |
| Terminology consistency | Extract core terms defined in SKILL.md. Check for: terms that conflict with the skill's own name, terms used with different meanings in different sections, terms that conflict with platform concepts. Report conflicts — don't auto-fix |
| Directory names | The Agent Skills standard names three skill directories: `references/`, `assets/`, `scripts/`. Flag non-standard directory names used for skill content. Directories serving only GitHub/repo presentation do not need renaming — just confirm they are not referenced by SKILL.md as skill content |
| Script quality | If `scripts/` exists: no single file >500 lines without justification; CLI parsing separated from business logic. See `references/script-quality.md` |
| README quality | **Invoke readme-craft** to audit README (3-tier hierarchy, badge selection, tone/voice, section overflow, layout quality). Additionally check skill-specific rules from `references/readme-quality.md`: value-first structure, claim discipline, dependency mirroring, footer, "What's Inside". If README does not exist (Review mode), flag as Critical and create in fix phase |
| Install command | Primary: `npx skills add <org>/<repo>`. Manual clone as fallback only |
| Dependency mirroring | If SKILL.md declares dependencies, mirror them in a README "Dependencies" section |
| No hardcoded paths | No personal paths (~/ expanded, /Users/specific/) in published files |
| LICENSE exists | Required for community platforms |
| Description clarity | Description alone should tell a stranger what this skill does and when to use it |
| Script documentation | If skill contains scripts, document what they do and what permissions they need |
| Discoverability claims | Do not imply GitHub publication guarantees immediate listing or search placement |

#### Repo Hygiene

These checks apply to the entire repository, not just skill content.

| Check | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| Leaked secrets | Scan all tracked files for common secret patterns: API keys (`sk-`, `ghp_`, `AKIA`, `xox[bpas]-`), tokens, passwords in config files, private keys (`-----BEGIN.*PRIVATE KEY-----`), hardcoded credentials. **Block push** until resolved |
| .gitignore coverage | Verify common entries: `.env*`, `node_modules/`, `.DS_Store`, IDE configs, OS files. Flag tracked files that match these patterns |
| Credential files | Warn if `.env`, `credentials.json`, `*.pem`, `*.key`, or secret-bearing config files are tracked by git |
| Unnecessary files | Flag files that add noise: lock files without a `scripts/` runtime, large media (> 1 MB), build artifacts, IDE workspace files |

**Severity levels:**
- **Critical** (leaked secrets, credential files) — block push, require immediate action
- **Warning** (missing .gitignore entries, unnecessary files) — report and recommend, do not block

Present all findings with severity. Critical issues block push.

#### Cross-Pillar Alignment (Review mode)

After structural checks, run self-review on the skill project to audit alignment across Design (README, docs), Artifact (SKILL.md, references, scripts), Skill (conventions), and Progress (changelog, roadmap). This catches drift that format validation misses — such as README claims diverging from SKILL.md execution logic, or stale progress tracking.

Report self-review findings alongside Step 3 results. Do not duplicate checks that Step 3 already covers (frontmatter, description coverage, repo hygiene).

#### Fix Phase

After validation report is presented and user approves fixes:

1. Fix all Critical issues (mandatory)
2. Fix Warning issues (with user confirmation)
3. For Review mode: create missing repo artifacts (README via readme-craft, LICENSE, .gitignore) if they don't exist
4. For both modes: update existing artifacts to pass validation
5. **Local registration** — detect platform roots, create symlinks:

   ```
   Scan for existing skill roots (strong signals only):
     Strong: ~/.claude/skills/, ~/.agents/skills/, ~/.copilot/skills/,
             ~/.cursor/skills/, ~/.codeium/windsurf/skills/
     Strong: <project>/.claude/skills/, <project>/.agents/skills/,
             <project>/.github/skills/, <project>/.cursor/skills/,
             <project>/.windsurf/skills/

     Roots found → link all detected roots
     No roots  → skip
     User explicitly names undetected platform → create root + link
   ```

   ```bash
   ln -sfn <skill-path> ~/.claude/skills/<skill-name>
   ```

   Never link one vendor root to another. Every consumer root points to the skill's source directory.

   See `references/platform-registry.md` for the platform matrix and policy.

6. **Git init** (if not already a git repo) + initial commit
7. Verify all Local Ready criteria are met

## Push to Remote

A single action, not a pipeline. Only available after local ready.

**Signal**: "push", "publish to GitHub", "put this on GitHub"

**Procedure**:

1. **Confirm** — summarize what will happen:
   - Remote target (`<org>/<skill-name>`, visibility)
   - Current local ready status

2. **Execute**:

   ```bash
   # Push to GitHub (default)
   gh repo create <org>/<skill-name> --public --source=. --push

   # Non-GitHub: ask for remote URL
   git remote add origin <url> && git push -u origin main

   # Update skill_root .gitignore (if skill_root is a git repo)
   # Add <skill-name>/ if not already present
   ```

3. **Update config** — add the skill to `~/.config/skill-forge/config.md` under "Published Skills"

4. **Report**: *"Your skill is on GitHub. Install with `npx skills add <org>/<skill-name>`. Community directories may surface it later based on their own indexing."*

**CC Market**: check `cc_market` in forge config. If `true` → include CC Market submission. If `false` → skip. If **not set** → ask once with recommendation to skip (GitHub is already installable), save preference. See `references/platform-registry.md` for details.
